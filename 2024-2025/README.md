# AI-Machine_Learning_at_ENSPIMA  
(September 2024)

## Goals

The main objective of this module is the introduction to Artificial Intelligence through one of its important component which is **Machine Learning** (ML) with **Neural Networks** (NN). 

The main classes of problems addressed by ML are exposed, with their principles, tools and limits of use, in the field of engineering. Programming, training and operating a neural network is illustrated from a practical point of view in Python language with the *tensorflow* and *keras* Python modules.

## Contents

The module includes:
- two lecture sessions of 1h20,
- 4 practical sessions of 3h each preferably carried out on the laptops of the students articulated around two sequences:
    - Discovery of Machine Learning: programming, training and evaluation of a dense neural network dedicated to the recognition of images from the MNIST data bank (handwritten digits).
    - Application to the context of aeronautical maintenance: design, training and evaluation of a dense neural network for the detection/classification of faults in data from a motor test bench.
    
### Intended learning outcomes: 
- Know the main classes of problems addressed by Machine Learning. 
- Know how to explain the behaviour of an artificial neuron and the overall architecture of a neural network.

With this course you will learn how to :
- build a dense or convolutional neural network with the Python tensorflow & keras modules
- download, preprocess and use a set of labeled data in order to train a neural network
- train a neural network and use precision and loss curves to limit the overfit
- operate a trained network (by oneself or by others) using a new dataset.

## Pedagogical method of acquisition

Practical work is done in Python language, preferably on student laptops. 	
The educational progression is done using a series of notebooks "with holes", of increasing difficulty, which allow the acquisition of the targeted skills.

## Prerequisites

Know the Python language for data processing and plotting curves using the *numpy* and *matplotlib* Python modules. 
Level of mathematics: bachelor.

## Evaluation

- an MCQ assessed individually (coef. 1/4)
- a report of practical work in pairs (coef. 3/4).
