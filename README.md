# AI-Machine_Learning_at_ENSPIMA  
(September 2025)

## Goals

The main objective of this module is the introduction to Artificial Intelligence through some of its main  components: **Machine Learning** (ML), **Neural Networks** (NN) and **Deep Learning** (DL).

The main classes of problems addressed by ML & DL are exposed, with their principles, tools and limits of use, in the field of engineering. Programming, training and operating a neural network is illustrated from a practical point of view in Python language with the *tensorflow* and *keras* Python modules.

## Contents

The module includes:
- two 1h20 lecture sessions,
- four 3h practical sessions, preferably conducted on students' laptops, organized around two sequences:
  - Introduction to machine learning with neural networks: programming, training, and evaluating a dense neural network dedicated to image recognition from the MNIST database (handwritten digits).
  - Application to defect detection: design, training, and evaluating a dense neural network for detecting/classifying defects in data from an engine test bench.
    
### Intended learning outcomes: 
- Know the main classes of problems addressed by Machine Learning. 
- Know how to explain the behaviour of an artificial neuron and the overall architecture of a neural network.

With this course you will learn how to :
- build a dense neural network with the Python tensorflow & keras modules
- download, preprocess and use a set of labeled data in order to train a neural network
- train a neural network and use precision and loss curves to limit the overfit
- operate a trained network (by oneself or by others) using a new dataset.

## Teaching method

Practical work is done in Python language, preferably on student's laptop. 	
The course progresses through a series of "fill-in-the-blank" NoteBooks of increasing difficulty, enabling students to acquire the targeted skills.

## Prerequisites

Know the Python language for data processing and plotting curves using the *numpy* and *matplotlib* Python modules. 
Level of mathematics: bachelor.

## Assessment

- a multiple-choice question (MCQ) assessed individually (weight 1/4)
- a mini-project report (in pairs, weight 3/4).
